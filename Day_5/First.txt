looping statement:
    looping statements are used to perform same task multiple times.
    there are various types of loops in c++

    1. While loop
    2. Do-while loop
    3. For loop

1. While loop
    While loop is entry controlled loop. When we dont know the exact number of times
    loop will be execute then we use this loop.
    Syntax:
        initialization;
        while(condition){
            //Code 
            //Body of the loop
            //Incre/Decre
        }

2. Do-While loop:
    Do-while loop is exit controlled loop. Condition is check after the execution of the body.
    Syntax:
        initialization;
        do{
            //body
            //Incre/Decre
        }
        while(Condition)

3. For loop
    for loop is also entry controlled loop in which condition is check at start if the given condition is true then body 
    of loop will be executed.
    Syntax:
        for(initialization;Condition;){
            //body of the loops
        }
