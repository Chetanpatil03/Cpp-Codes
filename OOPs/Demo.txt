need of oops:
    used to achieve modular programming.

def
    -- Class is factory that producing product(objects).
    -- Object is any real world entity.

    object have state and behaviour.

    
                -------- State ---------- Variables.
    object -----
                -------- Behaviour ------ Function/ Methods

Four Pillars of Object Oriented programming :
    1.Encapsulation
    2.Polymorphism
    3.Inheritance
    4.Abstraction

1. Encapsulation : 
    Wrapping data under single unit.
    When you wrape the data, data members, member Functions in a single module
    which is Class. It is called as Encapsulation.

    It is like a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside of the shield.

    Encapsulation 
        |
        |---- Data members --- Private
        |---- Member Functions --- Public


    Instace Variables are declared Private to prevent misuse.
    Providing Methods that can be used to read/write the state rather than accessing the state directly.
